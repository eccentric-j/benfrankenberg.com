# benfrankenberg.com

The source code for benfrankenberg.com, a portfolilo website for Benjamin Frankenberg.

## Overview
The site is statically generated by running all these source files through a build process and serving the results. Currently the site is setup in netlify.com and runs `npx gulp build` to populate the `dist` folder to serve to visitors.

This project is built as a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) meaning it's just JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. This means the entire site can be cached as content will not change between requests.

## Technologies
- [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) - Powers the build tooling, will be used to write the frontend.
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Reusable tasks structure and source-file streams
- [Highland](https://highlandjs.org/) - A functional-reactive-programming-based stream library to make gulp streams more powerful.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - A CSS pre-processor to provide more flexibility when writing stylesheets.
